In Stata, I used to use the Outreg2 command, but the output generated by this program has a weird format, and you always have to read some error messages in Excel.\nBecause of this, I decided to program a little piece of code to easily export my regression results to Excel. I\u0026rsquo;m not very creative, so I called my custom command export_tables. You can find the code at my Github page.\nSyntax export_tables, Models(string) Dec(real) Cell(string) USING(string) SHEET(string) [ Options ]\r Where:\n Models() contains a list of the models you estimated, and saved with the \u0026ldquo;Estimates Store\u0026rdquo; command. Dec() indicates the number of decimal places of your model\u0026rsquo;s coefficients. Cell() indicates in which Excel\u0026rsquo;s cell the table is going to begin. Using() indicates where are you going to save the excel document, and Sheet() indicates how the sheet of the document will be named. In options, you can use Keep() to keep the coefficients associated with certain variables, Drop() to drop the coefficients associated with some variables, Stats() to report some e() statistics stored in your models and Dstats() helps you to set the number of decimal places associated with these statistics. Variables prints the name of the variables in your table, and label prints the variables' labels instead. Std to display standard errors below the coefficients, Pvalues to display the p-values of the coefficients below them, and See to print your output in the console as a table.  How to use the command The idea behind the command is to run your regressions, store the results with estimates store, and then export the results to excel. You will get a table without a header, but you will see in every row the name of the variable, the coefficients of each model (with stars representing the significance level), the standard errors, and at the end, some statitics. After running this command, you can use putexcel to further modify your spreadsheet, adding headers, bold or italic text, borders, etc.\nFor the moment, this command only works with regression commands like reg, probit, ivreg2 or others, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with commands like heckman or others that display the results of 2 or more estimations at the same time.\nExample You can run the following example code:\nsysuse auto\rreg mpg rep78 trunk\rest sto m1\rreg turn length gear_ratio rep78\rest sto m2\rexport_tables, models(m1 m2) dec(2) cell(A1) using(\u0026quot;test.xlsx\u0026quot;) sheet(\u0026quot;sheet1\u0026quot;) stats(\u0026quot;N r2_a\u0026quot;) label std see\r You could also use a wilcard in the models, and write something like models(m*).\n","date":1555545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555545600,"objectID":"addee16a8f767222042cb01faada6a3f","permalink":"https://nicolas-suarez.github.io/blog/stata-tables/","publishdate":"2019-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/stata-tables/","section":"blog","summary":"A Stata ADO file to export tables to Excel without the problems of Outreg2","tags":[],"title":"A little Stata command to export tables to Excel","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Dante Contreras","Gabriel Otero","Juan Díaz","Nicolás Suárez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"d1edaba4fc000f3521fd8cb8bbb4367e","permalink":"https://nicolas-suarez.github.io/research/social-networks/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/social-networks/","section":"research","summary":"Long-standing literature argues that social capital is closely implicated in labour market outcomes. However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested in Latin America, the most unequal region in the world. We focus on Chile, one of the most stratified countries in Latin America. This study examines the relationship between social capital and four measures of status attainment, including job prestige and employment income. We use data from the first wave of the Longitudinal Social Study of Chile (ELSOC), a representative survey of the Chilean urban population aged 18–75 years. We analyse a subsample of 1,351 individuals who are currently employed. A Bayesian model of over-dispersion with relational data is used to estimate the size of the network, a novel measure of social capital. We analyse the data set using linear and logistic regression models and a complementary path analysis, first estimating models for the entire sample, and then splitting the sample into three groups to evaluate differences within individuals’ socioeconomic background. Results indicate that contacts’ occupational prestige has a positive association with job prestige and employment income, while the size of the network increases individuals’ salaries and labour participation. We also observe that social capital flows through stratified networks which tend to favour individuals from high socioeconomic backgrounds. We discuss the need to conduct more in-depth evaluations of how better creation of social capital and its effects on status attainment could be closely linked to positions of privilege and advantage accumulation processes in highly unequal contexts.","tags":["Published"],"title":"Inequality in social capital in Chile: Assessing the importance of network size and contacts’ occupational prestige on status attainment","type":"research"},{"authors":["Dante Contreras","Daniel Hojman","Manuel Matas","Patricio Rodríguez","Nicolás Suárez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"d992229d76fc5e8023cc6cf47d419381","permalink":"https://nicolas-suarez.github.io/research/commuting-time/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/commuting-time/","section":"research","summary":"Taking advantage of georeferenced data from Chilean students, we estimate the impact of commuting time over academic achievement. As the commuting time is an endogenous variable, we use instrumental variables and fixed effects at school level to overcome this problem. Also, as we don't know which mode of transport the students use, we complement our analysis using machine learning methods  to predict the transportation mode. Our findings suggest that the commuting time has a negative effect over academic performance, but this effect is not always significant.","tags":["Working Papers"],"title":"The impact of commuting time over educational achievement: A machine learning approach","type":"research"},{"authors":["Nicolás Suárez Chavarría","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
